My son said they were addicting. I cut the sugar a little because my family prefers less sweet treats, added a bit more pumpkin puree (because I used the whole can and that came in a little more than recipe asked for), and tossed in some super dark chocolate mini morsels. Turned out like soft but chewy pumpkin chocolate chip cookies that had the perfect balance of flavor and texture. The extra pumpkin make the batter runny, but If you make it this way, and like a chewy cookie, don\u2019t be alarmed, they came out perfect. I did add a little salt because I used unsalted butter. I did not add the frosting because I went the chocolate chip cookie route. I will make these again. Thanks for this recipe.
